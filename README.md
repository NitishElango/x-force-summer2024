## Project Name: Coordinated Activity Surveillance System (CASS) and Maritime Anomaly Detector (MAD)

### Description
The Coordinated Activity Surveillance System (CASS) and Maritime Anomaly Detector (MAD) project aims to identify anomalies and detect newly coordinated activities among multiple maritime vessels. The primary goal is to leverage publicly available historical maritime tracking data to uncover patterns of synchronized behavior. Examples of such coordinated activities include vessels concurrently departing from a location or traveling to similar regions.

This project involves advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, using tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow, to identify and predict coordinated activities among maritime vessels.

### Features
- **Data Extraction and Processing**: Efficiently handle and process large datasets of maritime tracking data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns and behaviors among vessels that have not previously operated in synchronization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize PyTorch and TensorFlow for building and training models to predict coordinated activities.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of identified patterns and anomalies for better analysis and interpretation.

### Installation
To get started with CASS and MAD, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CASS-MAD.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd CASS-MAD
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the specified directory.
2. Run the data processing script to clean and filter the data.
    ```sh
    python data_processing.py
    ```
3. Train the machine learning models using the prepared data.
    ```sh
    python train_model.py
    ```
4. Visualize the results and analyze the identified coordinated activities.
    ```sh
    python visualize_results.py
    ```
